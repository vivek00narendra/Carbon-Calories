# CarbonCalories

A Google Chrome Extension that calculates the carbon emissions for products on online grocery stores and provides the user with a score for each product in their shopping cart.

A low fedility prototype that works using dummy data that was created for a sample of products. 

The goal of the project was to provide users with a convenient way to make informed decisions on the groceries they purchase online by providing insight into their carbon footprint.

This was a group project where I was responsible for the backend Python and SQL work.
